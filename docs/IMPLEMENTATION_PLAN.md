# Skelet Implementation Plan

Status: CANONICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — implementation-ready
Repository: https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Skelet
Product thesis: Skelet is the design intelligence layer for humans and AI agents.
Commercial thesis: paid plans should target approximately 50% of the equivalent Mobbin plan price, while product differentiation must come from agent-native design intelligence rather than discounting.

## 1. Product Contract

Skelet MUST treat AI agents as first-class users. Anything discoverable by a human in the Skelet web UI MUST have a stable structured representation that can be retrieved through the API/MCP layer.

Primary product surfaces:
1. Research: products, versions, websites, screens, flows, patterns, copy, references.
2. Assets: icons, logos, fonts, components, illustrations, reusable resources.
3. Lens: paste a URL or image and return a structured design intelligence pack.
4. Agents: Remote MCP, MCP Apps, agent skills, REST API, TypeScript SDK, Python SDK, CLI.
5. Create: reference-to-editable-design workflows backed by OpenPencil; post-core launch unless core readiness is already met.

Launch-critical user journeys:
- Search across screens, flows, websites, components, icons, logos, fonts, and patterns from one query box.
- Paste a URL and receive screenshots, page/section structure, design tokens, brand assets, technology clues, QA findings, and agent-ready context.
- Connect an AI agent and perform search, inspect, compare, save, and create-reference-pack workflows without using the Skelet web UI.
- Save research to collections/workspaces and resume it from another agent/client.
- Retrieve assets with source, provenance, rights metadata, variants, and machine-usable formats.

Launch non-goals:
- Rebuilding Figma or a canvas engine.
- Building a mobile device farm before imported/permitted mobile corpus and web capture prove demand.
- Mandatory paid LLM inference.
- Mandatory paid crawler, vector SaaS, search SaaS, GPU, or cloud service.
- A generic web scraper product unrelated to design intelligence.

## 2. Architectural Principles

- Modular monolith first. Split services only after measured scaling pressure.
- PostgreSQL is the canonical transactional and graph-adjacency store.
- Binary media is content-addressed and stored outside Git.
- Search is provider-backed behind stable interfaces; no UI route depends directly on Orama, pgvector, or any external search vendor.
- Imported source code and imported datasets are governed separately.
- Every imported record is idempotent, provenance-bound, and traceable to an exact source identity.
- Every external provider is an adapter with explicit input/output contracts and timeouts.
- External AI egress is opt-in; local/deterministic analysis is the default.
- Agent interfaces are versioned public contracts, not wrappers around internal implementation details.
- Untrusted URLs, HTML, SVG, and uploaded files execute in isolated workers with no ambient credentials.

## 3. Canonical Domain Model

Canonical entities:
- Source: donor/provider/capture origin and rights/provenance identity.
- Product: app, website, service, brand, or product being studied.
- ProductVersion: immutable version/capture boundary for a Product.
- Artifact: common searchable design object.
- Asset: content-addressed binary or text asset.
- Flow: ordered user journey bound to a ProductVersion.
- FlowStep: ordered step referencing an Artifact and optional interaction/hotspot.
- Pattern: normalized UX/UI pattern taxonomy entry.
- Relation: typed directed edge between canonical objects.
- Collection: user/workspace research set.
- CaptureRun: one bounded ingestion/capture execution.
- AnalysisRun: deterministic or model-backed enrichment execution.
- ImportRecord: external source ID -> canonical Skelet ID mapping.

Artifact kinds at launch:
- screen
- page
- section
- component
- icon
- logo
- font
- illustration
- resource
- brief
- design

Required Artifact fields:
- id: UUIDv7
- kind
- product_id nullable
- product_version_id nullable
- title
- summary nullable
- canonical_text nullable
- metadata JSONB
- source_id
- source_record_id nullable
- captured_at nullable
- created_at
- updated_at
- content_hash
- rights_classification
- visibility

Required Asset fields:
- id
- sha256
- media_type
- byte_length
- width/height/duration nullable
- storage_key
- source_url nullable
- source_id
- rights_classification
- metadata JSONB

Required Relation fields:
- from_type/from_id
- relation_type
- to_type/to_id
- confidence nullable
- evidence JSONB nullable

Initial relation types:
contains, belongs_to, uses, derived_from, visually_similar_to, semantically_similar_to, appears_in, follows, precedes, variant_of, extracted_from, references.

Do NOT create separate canonical databases for icons, components, screens, and websites. Typed extension tables may be introduced only for fields that become performance-critical or require relational integrity beyond JSONB.

## 4. Runtime Architecture

Initial deployable units:
1. web: Next.js application containing human UI, REST API, Remote MCP endpoint, MCP App resources, auth, billing, collections, search orchestration, and read-side APIs.
2. worker: Node.js worker process for capture, imports, analysis, embeddings, document processing, and scheduled refresh jobs.
3. PostgreSQL: canonical records, users/workspaces, job state, search metadata, full-text search, and pgvector embeddings.
4. Object storage: local filesystem adapter in development; S3-compatible/R2 adapter in production.

Avoid Redis at launch. Use a PostgreSQL-backed queue (pg-boss or equivalent) so jobs participate in one operational database and can be replayed/audited.

Repository target structure after the initial upstream snapshot is qualified:

apps/
  web/
  worker/
packages/
  domain/
  db/
  search/
  storage/
  provenance/
  providers/
  mcp/
  registry/
  testkit/
scripts/
  imports/
  capture/
  provenance/
docs/
  architecture/
  product/
  provenance/
  operations/
fixtures/

Use pnpm workspaces. Do not introduce Turborepo unless build measurements show a material need.

## 5. Provider Boundaries

Base/selective upstream:
- Monet Registry: website/component registry engine, page/section metadata concepts, capture/search/build scripts. Import selectively, exclude bulk media and product-owned branding/data not required by Skelet.

Transplant/adapters:
- OpenSourceUI: catalog UX, component preview patterns, quality checks, selected component data.
- Better Auth/PaceKit: authentication UX/flows; database remains Skelet PostgreSQL.
- Better Auth Stripe plugin: subscription/customer/team-seat lifecycle.
- Iconify: normalized icon collections and metadata.
- Simple Icons/SVGL/authorized logo datasets: brand/logo corpus.
- Fontsource: font metadata/assets where redistribution rights allow.
- shadcn registry specification: canonical component distribution contract.
- Dembrandt: design-token/design-system extraction provider.
- OpenBrand: brand/logo/color extraction provider.
- OpenTechAlyzer: technology detection provider.
- Squirrelscan: website QA/history provider where useful.
- rrweb: compact web-flow recording/replay.
- Maestro: later mobile flow automation provider.
- OmniParser + local OCR: screenshot/UI parsing worker for image-only artifacts.
- OpenPencil: Create/editor provider after core launch readiness.
- Docling: document/brand-guide ingestion worker.
- Firecrawl: fallback crawler only when native capture is insufficient.

Every provider MUST implement:
- capability identifier
- version/source pin
- deterministic configuration record
- timeout and cancellation
- input schema
- output schema
- provenance emission
- error classification
- health check
- optional cost/egress classification

## 6. Ingestion Contract

All imports and captures flow through one normalized pipeline:

source -> raw record -> canonical normalization -> asset dedupe -> provenance validation -> enrichment -> search indexing -> publish

Rules:
- Raw payloads are retained only when permitted and useful for replay/debugging.
- ImportRecord provides idempotency with source_id + external_id + source_version uniqueness.
- Asset bytes are deduplicated by SHA-256 before upload.
- A failed enrichment MUST NOT corrupt or partially publish the canonical object.
- Publish is a final state transition after required validators pass.
- Re-importing identical content MUST be a no-op except for audit timestamps.
- Importers MUST expose dry-run mode and deterministic fixture tests.

## 7. Search Architecture

One public search contract serves humans, REST clients, and MCP clients.

Initial engines:
- PostgreSQL full-text search for canonical text, OCR, names, tags, and metadata projections.
- pgvector for text/image embeddings and nearest-neighbor retrieval.
- Existing Monet/Orama logic may remain temporarily behind an adapter during migration, but must not become a second canonical search contract.

SearchDocument projection:
- object_id/object_type
- title
- searchable_text
- product/category/platform
- tags/patterns/elements
- colors/style/layout/industry facets
- rights/visibility
- popularity/quality/freshness signals
- text_embedding
- visual_embedding nullable

Ranking v1:
- lexical relevance
- semantic similarity
- visual similarity when image query exists
- quality score
- provenance completeness
- freshness
- user/workspace context only when explicitly allowed

Search MUST support:
- text -> any artifact
- image -> visually similar artifacts
- artifact -> similar artifacts
- typed filters
- product/version scoped search
- flow/pattern search
- asset/license filtering

## 8. Skelet Lens

Input: URL or uploaded image.

URL analysis pipeline:
1. URL canonicalization and SSRF validation.
2. Isolated Playwright/Monet capture.
3. Screenshot + DOM + sections + asset inventory.
4. Dembrandt token/design-system extraction.
5. OpenBrand brand/logo/color extraction.
6. OpenTechAlyzer technology detection.
7. Optional Squirrelscan QA/a11y/SEO/security report.
8. Local OCR/OmniParser only for image-only/opaque regions that DOM analysis cannot explain.
9. Embedding generation.
10. Canonical Product/ProductVersion/Artifact graph publication.
11. Agent Context Pack generation.

Lens output contract:
- overview
- screenshots/pages/sections
- colors/typography/spacing/radius/shadows/motion
- logos/icons/images/fonts
- detected components/patterns
- technology clues with confidence/source
- QA findings
- provenance
- similar Skelet references
- exports: JSON, DESIGN.md, DTCG tokens, Tailwind theme, shadcn theme when supported, agent-context JSON

Lens MUST clearly distinguish observed facts, deterministic inference, heuristic inference, and model-generated interpretation.

## 9. Agent Platform Contract

Canonical remote endpoint:
- /mcp over Streamable HTTP.

Public resources use stable URIs:
- skelet://product/{id}
- skelet://version/{id}
- skelet://artifact/{id}
- skelet://flow/{id}
- skelet://collection/{id}
- skelet://lens/{analysis_id}
- skelet://reference-pack/{id}

Keep the tool surface small and composable. Launch tools:
- search_design: unified search with kind/facet/query/image/reference filters.
- get_object: retrieve structured canonical objects by Skelet URI or ID.
- find_similar: semantic/visual/pattern similarity.
- compare_design: compare products, versions, artifacts, or flows with evidence references.
- analyze_url: create or retrieve a Lens analysis.
- analyze_image: ingest/analyze an uploaded screenshot or design image.
- resolve_asset: return machine-usable asset variants plus rights/provenance.
- save_reference: save an object to a collection/workspace.
- create_reference_pack: create compact agent context from selected evidence.
- get_changes: retrieve version/capture differences for a Product.
- search_registry: search Skelet's shadcn-compatible component registry.

Do not expose one MCP tool per internal micro-operation. The agent contract should model user intent, while internal providers remain implementation details.

MCP Apps launch views:
- search gallery
- flow player
- visual compare
- icon/logo picker
- Lens Design DNA report
- reference board

Agent Skills:
- skelet-research: research real shipped references before proposing UI.
- skelet-assets: select icons/logos/fonts/components with rights metadata.
- skelet-lens: analyze a URL and generate implementation context.
- skelet-reference-pack: persist/reuse evidence across agents.

All agent outputs MUST reference Skelet IDs/URIs so a later agent can recover the source evidence without relying on prose copied into chat history.

## 10. Assets and Registry

Assets surface is launch-critical, not a secondary directory.

Icon pipeline:
- ingest normalized metadata from Iconify-compatible collections.
- preserve collection/source/license metadata.
- generate searchable semantic aliases without changing source attribution.
- support SVG delivery and optional PNG/rendered variants.

Logo pipeline:
- imported brand-logo datasets + OpenBrand extraction.
- record trademark/brand-guideline URL separately from code/content license.
- maintain light/dark/monochrome/mark/wordmark variants when known.

Font pipeline:
- normalized family/style/weight/variable/license metadata.
- do not serve restricted font files merely because metadata can be indexed.

Component pipeline:
- Skelet publishes a shadcn-compatible registry.
- donor components are normalized to registry items only when dependencies and source/provenance are known.
- component metadata links to real shipped references when available.
- registry items include clear agent-oriented descriptions and dependency metadata.

## 11. Security, Privacy, and Abuse Boundaries

URL capture security:
- reject file:// and non-http(s) schemes.
- resolve DNS before navigation and block loopback, link-local, private, carrier-grade NAT, metadata-service, and reserved ranges.
- revalidate every redirect target and protect against DNS rebinding.
- run browsers in isolated workers with no production session cookies, cloud credentials, SSH keys, or filesystem secrets.
- enforce page timeout, download byte limits, navigation count limits, concurrency limits, and browser process memory/CPU bounds.
- sanitize/contain SVG and HTML previews; never render untrusted markup in a privileged same-origin application context.

MCP/API security:
- OAuth/session-backed user authorization for remote MCP.
- workspace-scoped permissions.
- rate limits and quotas by plan/capability.
- read-only tools by default; writes require authenticated workspace authority.
- logs MUST redact tokens, cookies, API keys, and uploaded secrets.
- BYOK model keys are never returned to clients after storage and are never included in observability payloads.

Data/AI privacy:
- deterministic/local analysis is default.
- external model calls require an explicit provider configuration and egress classification.
- every external analysis run records provider/model, input classes, cost estimate when available, and retention policy.
- private workspace content must never enter global ranking/training/corpus enrichment without explicit permission.

## 12. Provenance and Rights

Maintain separate files/tables for code provenance and data provenance.

UPSTREAMS.lock.yml fields:
- id
- source_url
- exact_commit_or_release
- role: base/transplant/adapter/dataset/reference
- imported_paths or capability
- permission_basis
- license
- modifications
- verification_date

DATA_PROVENANCE records:
- dataset/source identity
- owner/provider
- permission scope
- redistribution allowed/forbidden/unknown
- derivative metadata allowed/forbidden/unknown
- asset serving policy
- trademark/brand restrictions where applicable
- import batch IDs

No donor branch name is sufficient evidence. Every implemented import binds to an exact immutable commit/release/content hash verified at execution time.

## 13. CI and Review Gates

Every implementation PR must bind evidence to its exact PR HEAD.

Required automated gates:
- format/lint
- TypeScript typecheck
- unit tests
- database migration validation
- schema compatibility tests
- importer idempotency tests
- provider contract tests
- SSRF/security regression tests for URL capture
- auth/workspace authorization tests
- MCP JSON schema/contract tests
- REST API contract tests
- Playwright critical-path E2E
- build
- provenance lock validation
- generated registry validation
- no committed large/binary corpus gate

Review gates:
- TypeSafe Jev exact-diff review with a pinned reviewer/runtime and machine-readable report.
- Alibaba Open Code Review exact-HEAD review where available.
- zero unresolved blocking findings before merge.

Merge policy:
- ordinary merge commits only.
- no force-push.
- no rebase/history rewriting on governed branches.
- post-merge main verification is required before the grain is marked canonical.

## 15. Dependency Graph and Launch Cut

Hard dependencies:
P00 -> P01 -> P02 -> P03 -> P05
P03 -> P04
P05 -> P06 -> P07
P06 + P03 -> P08
P05 + P03 -> P09
P03 + P05 -> P10
P06 + P07 + P09 + P10 -> P11
P08 + P11 -> P12
P09 + P10 + P11 -> P13
P08 + P11 + P12 -> P14
P04 + P06 + P08 + P09 + P10 + P11 + P12 -> P15

Commercial launch MUST NOT be blocked by P13 Time Machine or P14 Create if the core launch journeys are qualified.

Minimum paid launch scope:
- unified search
- Assets: icons/logos/fonts/components
- Research: products/sites/screens/flows from qualified corpus
- Lens URL analysis
- collections/reference packs
- Remote MCP + skills + REST API
- auth/workspaces/billing
- provenance/rights display

Post-launch/beta scope:
- Create/OpenPencil
- automated mobile device farm
- broad continuous watch/Time Machine schedules
- enterprise SSO/SCIM
- hosted external LLM subsidy

## 16. Grain Execution Rules

Each implementation grain MUST contain:
- one bounded objective
- exact base SHA
- exact branch/head SHA
- explicit files/contract surface
- tests/evidence required before implementation starts
- implementation
- local qualification
- Jev exact-diff report
- Alibaba OCR report where available
- PR exact-head CI
- ordinary merge commit
- post-merge main qualification
- canonical closeout record

Do not combine unrelated donor imports, database migrations, UI redesign, and agent contract changes in one grain.

## 17. Initial Launch SLO Targets

These are planning targets and must be benchmarked before launch:
- Search API p95: < 500 ms for cached/common queries; < 1.5 s for hybrid visual/semantic queries.
- MCP read tool p95 excluding heavy analysis jobs: < 1 s.
- Lens submission acknowledgement: < 1 s; heavy analysis is asynchronous with job state.
- Lens normal public-page completion target: < 60 s, with provider-level partial results instead of total failure when optional analyzers fail.
- asset metadata/API availability: 99.9% target after production launch.
- zero cross-workspace data exposure in authorization test matrix.

## 18. Product Success Metrics

Agent metrics:
- successful MCP sessions
- tool success/error rate
- search-to-evidence selection rate
- reference-pack creation/use rate
- repeat agent usage by workspace
- median number of Skelet evidence objects used per completed agent task

Human metrics:
- search -> artifact view
- artifact -> save/reference-pack
- URL -> Lens completion
- asset -> copy/download/install
- collection reuse

Commercial metrics:
- free -> paid conversion
- paid retention
- infrastructure cost per active workspace
- heavy-analysis cost per paid workspace

Quality metrics:
- search relevance benchmark
- provenance completeness
- duplicate rate
- broken asset rate
- stale capture rate
- importer replay success
- provider failure isolation rate

## 19. Stop/Defer Rules

Do not add a new vendor/provider when an existing qualified provider covers the same launch requirement unless benchmark evidence shows a material quality, cost, rights, or reliability advantage.

Do not build a custom subsystem when a permitted mature donor can satisfy the requirement behind an adapter without weakening the canonical Skelet domain.

Do not make Create, mobile device capture, or paid LLM inference a prerequisite for initial commercial launch.

Do not optimize for Mobbin feature parity at the expense of the agent-first contract. The launch criterion is that an agent can discover, understand, cite, save, and reuse design evidence better than through a screenshot-only library.

## 20. First Implementation Grains

G03-01: Database foundation
- Depends: G02-02
- Adds: PostgreSQL adapter/migration runner and Source/Product/ProductVersion.
- Proves: migrate up from empty and recreate deterministic test database.

G03-02: Artifact/Asset/Relation schema
- Depends: G03-01
- Adds: Artifact, Asset, Relation, Pattern and content hash constraints.
- Proves: common artifact kinds and graph edges round-trip.

G03-03: Flow/Collection/Run/Import schema
- Depends: G03-02
- Adds: Flow, FlowStep, Collection, CaptureRun, AnalysisRun, ImportRecord.
- Proves: idempotent external mapping and ordered flow traversal.

G03-04: Object storage
- Depends: G03-02
- Adds: StorageProvider interface + local filesystem implementation + SHA-256 dedupe.
- Proves: duplicate bytes share canonical asset identity/storage object.

G04-01: Better Auth baseline
- Depends: G03-03

- Proves: session/auth integration tests.

G04-02: Workspaces and roles
- Depends: G04-01

G04-03: Collections
- Depends: G04-02
- Adds: collection create/read/update/delete and save-reference path.
- Proves: user can persist a canonical Skelet object reference.

G04-04: Billing adapter
- Depends: G04-02
- Adds: Better Auth Stripe plugin behind config/feature gate and capability plan model.
- Proves: signed webhook, replay handling, seats fixture; production prices remain configuration.

G05-01: Job queue lifecycle
- Depends: G03-03
- Adds: PostgreSQL-backed queue, job identity, cancellation, retry/backoff, dead-letter state.
- Proves: duplicate enqueue/retry/cancel fixtures.

G05-02: Provider contract
- Depends: G05-01
- Adds: provider schemas, timeout/cancellation, health, provenance, egress/cost classification.
- Proves: fake good/timeout/malformed providers.

G05-03: Publish transaction
- Depends: G05-02 + G03-04
- Adds: raw -> normalize -> asset dedupe -> validate -> publish pipeline.
- Proves: failed optional enrichment yields partial analysis status but no corrupt canonical publish; required validation failure publishes nothing.

After G05-03, P06+ work may run as parallel feature branches only when they do not modify the same public contract. Domain/API/schema changes remain serialized through normal merge commits.

Branch naming pattern: skelet/pXX-gYY-short-name.

## 21. Mandatory Security Qualification Matrix

URL/Lens tests MUST include:
- localhost/127.0.0.0/8 rejection.
- IPv6 loopback/link-local/private rejection.
- RFC1918/private-address rejection.
- cloud metadata endpoint rejection.
- public DNS resolving to private IP rejection.
- redirect from public URL to private/reserved target rejection.
- DNS rebinding simulation/revalidation.
- file:, data:, javascript:, ftp: and unsupported-scheme rejection.
- oversized response/download termination.
- redirect-loop/navigation-budget termination.
- page timeout and browser-process cleanup.
- hostile SVG/script preview isolation.
- capture worker environment test proving no production secrets are present.

Auth/MCP tests MUST include:
- anonymous read/write policy matrix.
- user A cannot read/write workspace B.
- user cannot forge workspace/reference IDs.
- write tools require explicit authenticated authority.
- expired/revoked session denial.
- rate-limit/quota enforcement.
- MCP/REST error bodies do not leak secrets/internal stack traces.
- provider/BYOK secrets are redacted from logs and result payloads.

External egress tests MUST include:
- deterministic Lens path succeeds with all external LLM providers disabled.
- private workspace content is not sent to an external model without explicit configured provider/permission.
- AnalysisRun records provider/model and egress classification when external inference is used.

## 22. Public Contract Versioning

Version independently:
- REST API: /api/v1; breaking changes require /api/v2 or a documented compatibility window.
- MCP tools/resources: semantic schema version recorded in server metadata; breaking tool input/output changes require new tool/resource version or compatibility adapter.
- Skelet URI identity is stable across API versions.
- registry schema follows the pinned shadcn registry specification and validates in CI.
- database schema is internal and may evolve through forward migrations; public APIs never expose table shapes as contracts.

Contract fixtures are stored in packages/testkit/contracts and diffed in CI. A change to a public schema MUST include an explicit compatibility classification in the PR.
