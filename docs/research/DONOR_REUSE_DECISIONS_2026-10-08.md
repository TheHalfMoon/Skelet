# Skelet Donor Reuse Decisions — Research Snapshot (2026-10-08)

Status: SOURCE DISCOVERY AND ADAPTER STRATEGY ONLY. Links are candidate references, not automatic permission or a verified pin. The canonical `UPSTREAMS.lock.yml` and individual import manifest remain the only activation route.

## Decision order

1. Reuse an **already qualified implementation** in Skelet.
2. Reuse a **mature permissive or otherwise specifically authorized project** with the smallest capability-scoped patch.
3. Use an upstream official API, SDK or registry **as a versioned adapter**, not a monolithic donor transplant.
4. Build the **Skelet-owned integration/domain code** only where no fitting reusable contract exists.

Before copying: verify live repo, exact source commit, release, implementation presence, mandatory notice/license and third-party component/asset rights; map imported source to an acceptance test; inspect vulnerabilities, weight/dependency restrictions, license compatibility, maintenance burden and transitive APIs; retain an immutable per-path manifest. **Founder-stated permission is evidence for its exact scope; it does not turn missing upstream licenses or external media into public domain.**

## High-confidence reusable upstream candidates

| Capability | Source / exact public location | Recommended use | Decision / hard gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capturing pages, DOM, screenshots, browser tests | [microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) | Core browser primitive plus traces/synthetic fixture playback | **ADAPT**, isolate workers and enforce network egress, no user secrets |
| Design token extraction | [dembrandt/dembrandt](https://github.com/dembrandt/dembrandt) | Lens adapter: CSS/token computation, W3C DTCG, DESIGN.md | **ADAPT**, verify headless browser version and export determinism |
| Web/catalog/search baseline | [monet-design/monet-registry](https://github.com/monet-design/monet-registry) | Selectively reuse verified code-only paths | **PARTIAL**, exact source commit in manifest; 45 qualified candidates and 45 quarantined; not a runnable standalone app |
| Component catalogue | [bidyut10/opensourceui](https://github.com/bidyut10/opensourceui) | Research UX and selected components | **EVALUATE**, select original code/license/assets per component |
| Component install contract | [shadcn registry specification](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) | Skelet native public component registry | **ADOPT SPEC**, registry validation and clean sample-app install required |
| Registry directory | [shadcn registry index](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-index) | Distribution of public valid Skelet registry | **OPTIONAL PUBLISH**, not required for direct use |
| Icons | [iconify/icon-sets](https://github.com/iconify/icon-sets) | Metadata import and exact licensed sets | **ADOPT SELECTIVELY**, each collection license differs; no all-set blanket allowance |
| Brand icon metadata | [simple-icons/simple-icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) | Brand/logo metadata and licensed byte variants | **SELECTIVE**, trademark rules and per-logo serving restrictions |
| Fonts | [fontsource/fontsource](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource) | Font metadata, select file bundles | **ADAPT**, check license of **each** family/file; metadata-only if restricted |
| Authentication & organization | [better-auth/better-auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth) | Better Auth and organization plugin | **ADAPT**, own PostgreSQL workspace authorization and lifecycle |
| Auth UX seed | [paceui/nextjs-better-auth-starter](https://github.com/paceui/nextjs-better-auth-starter) | Selected consent/login/organization UX | **EVALUATE**, UI-only where possible; avoid copying starter product identity |
| Postgres job queue | [timgit/pg-boss](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss) | Retry/lease queue behind Skelet job interface | **EVALUATE**, idempotence and transaction/outbox tested |
| Search index | [pgvector/pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) | Optional embedded vector similarity, alongside PostgreSQL FTS | **EVALUATE**, start lexical and benchmark CPU/rights before adopting |
| Page technology hints | [Houseofmvps/opentechalyzer](https://github.com/Houseofmvps/opentechalyzer) | Bounded, low-confidence tech-clue adapter | **EVALUATE**, no intrusive scans or certainty laundering |
| Brand clues | [tight-studio/OpenBrand](https://github.com/tight-studio/OpenBrand) | Extract logo/brand clues | **EVALUATE**, extracted bytes are not automatically redistributable |
| Visual QA | [squirrelscan/squirrelscan](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan) | Optional website audit provider | **DEFER/ADAPT**, Lens must work with provider disabled |
| Flow replay | [rrweb-io/rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) | Authorized flow recording and replay | **ADAPT LATER**, remove PII, retention and capture consent |
| MCP protocol | [modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) | 2026-07-28 normative contract, OAuth, Tasks extension | **ADOPT CONTRACT**, negotiate compatible clients |
| MCP Apps SDK | [modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) | `ui://` viewers via official SDK and templates | **ADOPT SDK**, host compatibility and sandbox gates |
| Design editor/export | [open-pencil/open-pencil](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil) | Edit/export design handoff without Skelet canvas | **ADAPT POST CORE**, real import/export round-trip proof |
| OCR / UI parsing | [microsoft/OmniParser](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser) | Optional screenshot element extraction | **DEFER**, CPU/GPU cost and model-weight rights must be evaluated |
| Documents | [docling-project/docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling) | Optional local brand guide ingestion | **EVALUATE POST S1**, not baseline requirement |
| Crawl fallback | [firecrawl/firecrawl](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl) | Optional provider when Playwright capture insufficient | **DEFER/ADAPT**, no mandatory cloud or paid quota, rights and egress tested |
| Mobile capture | [mobile-dev-inc/Maestro](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/Maestro) | Bounded mobile flow automation later | **DEFER**, no mobile device farm for v1 |
| Existing agent/web patterns | [browser-use/browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) | Reference for guarded browser actions, not core autonomous crawler | **REFERENCE**, permission and task sandbox before considering donor code |

## TheHalfMoon cross-repository reuse — verify implementation, not claims

GitHub repository presence/readme verified in the connected TheHalfMoon account on 2026-10-08. These are potential internal source providers, **not automatic dependencies**.

| Existing repo | Possible capability boundary | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Lilac](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Lilac) | Design editing, format roundtrip and canvas | **COOPERATE**, keep Skelet read/evidence and Lilac edit/design |
| [Kernux](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/kernux) | Browser/agent capability authorization and sandbox | **REFERENCE FOR NOW**; README explicitly reports no implementation started |
| [Deskal](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Deskal) | Trusted local desktop/computer transport | **POTENTIAL ADAPTER**, never import unrestricted computer permissions into web capture |
| [Orcel](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Orcel) | Durable agent skills/harness conventions | **REFERENCE/SDK ADAPTER**, preserve public MCP semantics |
| [Morize](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Morize) | Provenance-aware cross-agent memory | **OPTIONAL ADAPTER**, not Skelet's canonical storage |
| [Gomrey](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Gomrey) | Evidence/document ingestion workflows | **CANDIDATE DONOR**, only if implementation exists and per-grain tests support reuse |
| [Inercative](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Inercative) | Agent-driven app generation | **CONSUMER PARTNER**, no duplicate builder in Skelet |
| [SpecGrain](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/SpecGrain) | Small implementation grains/contracts | **GOVERNANCE REUSE**, no forced runtime coupling |
| [Diffcipline](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Diffcipline) | Exact-diff proof/closeout discipline | **GOVERNANCE REUSE**, no product endpoint |
| [Ascout](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Ascout) | QA/security/test integration patterns | **REVIEW ADAPTER CANDIDATE**, do not substitute for required Alibaba OCR/Jev |
| [Olax](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Olax) | Company/agent decision workflows | **OUT OF CORE**, no reason to import for design discovery |

Private repos (when accessible) require the **same** exact source, right-to-disclose, per-path manifest, and no-secret checks. No automatic import from private code into this **public** Skelet repository.

## Explicit reject/defer choices

- **Do not use Mobbin, commercial screenshot-site scraping, or undocumented datasets as a shortcut** to building a rights-cleared corpus; third-party UI captures do not become redistributable simply because technically reachable.
- **Do not import an entire monorepo** to gain one icon picker, registry endpoint or OAuth flow. A small wrapper and exact upstream SDK are usually cheaper to maintain.
- **Do not introduce a second graph database, object store, auth authority, or search contract** because a donor bundles one. Skelet owns its canonical data.
- **Do not build a new Figma-class editor**; design handoff via OpenPencil/Lilac is a post-core integration.
- **Do not require hosted Firecrawl, paid inference, cloud GPU, mobile farm, or always-on vector search** to qualify the first functional app.
- **Do not use copied donor product branding or hardcoded donor redirects**; quarantine and adapt them in English under separate exact-grain review.
- **Do not introduce extra LLM reasoning providers for deterministic metadata extraction** until benchmark proves measurable benefit.

## Mandatory reusable-source scorecard

Before every donor acceptance, record numeric/qualitative evidence for:

1. **Capability coverage:** which exact user/API journey and contract fixtures it satisfies.
2. **Code existence:** runnable/reachable module and exact commit plus imported paths.
3. **Rights:** SPDX/license or scoped authorization; separately list datasets/assets/fonts/logos/weights/trademarks and notices.
4. **Integration cost:** direct transitive dependencies, platform assumptions, patch footprint, maintenance and portability.
5. **Safety:** URL egress, sandbox, arbitrary file access, prompt injection, secrets, vulnerabilities, dependency provenance.
6. **Quality:** deterministic tests, typecheck/build, runtime smoke, latency/memory and failure-mode fixtures.
7. **Vendor exit:** adapter replaceable without changing Skelet canonical identity, history or API schemas.
8. **Ownership:** keeper, upstream pin, update cadence, security response and rollback path.

States: `discovered -> rights_checked -> source_verified -> contract_qualified -> integrated -> launch_qualified`; `blocked` or `rejected` on a failure. The original `planned/ready/imported` source lock remains authoritative for actual imports and must not be silently upgraded by this research table.
